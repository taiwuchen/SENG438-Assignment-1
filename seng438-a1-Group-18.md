-   Note that you need to submit a report generated by your defect tracking
    system, containing all defects recorded in the system.

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

We found, on reviewing the defect report of the other pair, several similarities of their test cases to ours, such as both teams tested the same core ATM functions: withdrawals, deposits, transfers, and balance checking, and therefore it would be expected that both pairs would replicate some tests on it. Another similarity: both sets of defect reports were clear and easy to follow. It made it so easy to redo the tests and pinpoint the mistakes in retesting.

However, there were some dissimilarities, one of which was a range of amounts tested in the examples of withdrawals and deposits; the variance revealed some mathematical problems had been programmed. Additionally, certain errors in the program’s outputs weren’t always documented by each team.

Ultimately, the possession of two sets of defect reports would serve to detect some of the other team's missed points for creating a better test set that would be much more thorough and precise.

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

Some difficulties encountered included creation of tests and choosing highly effective tests that would ensure each functionality of the system is thoroughly operational. We used a implementation of generative AI to help, analyze and extract. Key tests required to analyze the functionality. This was integrated into exploratory testing from both pairs allowing a more in-depth review overall. Some lessons we learned as a team was how to write bug reports as well as clearly demonstrate testing of each functionality and identifying bugs efficiently. We also learned how to communicate and distribute work efficiently to create optimal results.
